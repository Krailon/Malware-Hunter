Malware-Hunter
==============

I got tired of manually sifting through spam email and digging around search engines, thus Malware Hunter was born.
Planned features include:
- POP3/OAUTH email fetching for harvesting spam links
- Automatic redirect following
- Limited Javascript deobfuscation
- Custom pattern-matching meta-language for identifying threat types
- High-level binary threat analysis to decide whether samples should be submitted to Malwr
